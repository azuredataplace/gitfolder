Dear Dad, 
I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to ask for your help with a financial situation I have found myself in recently. As you know, college tuition is expensive and my scholarship only covers part of the cost. The remaining balance has put me in a difficult position and any assistance would be greatly appreciated. 

As such, I am asking if it would be possible for you to lend me one hundred dollars so that I can pay off the remainder of my tuition fees? This money will enable me to keep up with my studies without having to worry about how much money is left over each month after paying bills and other expenses associated with attending college. It will also give me peace of mind knowing that all necessary costs are taken care of before classes start again next semester. 

I understand if this request may not fit into your budget at this time; however, any amount that could be provided would make an immense difference in helping reduce some stress from trying to manage school finances on top of studying full-time at university level courses! Thank you for considering my request - no matter what decision is made - as always dad thank-you very much for being there when things get tough! With love & appreciation always yours truly,.  

Sincerely Yours ,  Dataplace
